### Unreleased

* Update Polish translations (PR: #192, @Twoomatch)

### Version 1.26

* Update Turkish and Russian translations (PR: #188, @EleoXDA)
* Add hidden feature to customize the output filename (PR: #189, @chenxiaolong)
  * To avoid complicating BCR's code, there is no UI option for this
  * To customize the output filenames, copy [the default template](./app/src/main/res/raw/filename_template.properties) to `bcr.properties` in the output directory and edit the file

### Version 1.25

* Add SIM slot ID to the filename if there are multiple active SIMs (Issue: #177, PR: #178, @chenxiaolong)
* Fix share action in the recording complete notification always referencing an old recording (PR: #181, @chenxiaolong)
* Add a new Delete action alongside Open and Share in the notifications (Issue: #179, PR: #182, @chenxiaolong)
* Allow changing output settings when call recording is disabled (PR: #183, @chenxiaolong)

Documentation changes:
* README.md: Explain what every permission is used for (PR: #180, @chenxiaolong)

Non-user-facing changes:
* Update gradle wrapper to 7.6.0 (PR: #174, @PatrykMis)

### Version 1.24

* Notification improvements (PR: #169, @chenxiaolong)
  * A notification is now shown when a recording completes, with options for opening or sharing the recording in a 3rd party app.
    * **NOTE: Manual action required.** For opening/sharing recordings to work, reset the output directory to the default and then select the output directory again. This is required because BCR previously only requested write access to the output directory, but not read access.
    * These new notifications can be disabled in Android's settings by turning off the `Success alerts` notification channel.
  * The file path in error notifications is now human readable instead of a URL-encoded `content://...`.
* BCR will explicitly vibrate if vibration is enabled for its notification channels (PR: #167, #171, @quyenvsp, @chenxiaolong)
  * This is needed because Android will not respect the notification vibration option during a phone call.

Non-user-facing changes:
* Updated all dependencies (PR: #160, @PatrykMis)
* Fixed Gradle non-laziness, causing the execution of specific tasks to be slower (PR: #168, @chenxiaolong)

  * Only applies to LineageOS-based firmware
* Improve logging in debug mode (Issue: #143, PR: #145, #147, #148, @chenxiaolong)
  * Run logcat interactively for the duration of the call to ensure no lost log messages due to logcat overflow
  * Include BCR version number in the logs
* Improve output file writing reliability (Issue: #143, PR: #146, #149, #150, @chenxiaolong)
* Improve call disconnection detection on buggy firmware (Issue: #143, PR: #151, @chenxiaolong)
  * Works around Samsung OneUI's telephony framework bug where Android does not notify apps (including their own) when a call disconnects
* Use non-blocking reads from call audio stream (Issue: #143, PR: #152, @chenxiaolong)
  * Fixes recordings not stopping until another call becomes active on Samsung OneUI because `AudioRecord.read()` blocks forever as soon as a call disconnects

* Show user-friendly path instead of a raw URI for the output directory (PR: #71, @chenxiaolong)
